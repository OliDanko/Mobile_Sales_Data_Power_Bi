🖥️ Interactive Mobile Sales Dashboard

This project showcases a fully interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing mobile device sales. It simulates the complete workflow of a data analyst – from data preparation and KPI calculation to advanced analytics and visual storytelling.

🗄 Data Preparation

Before building the dashboard, data was prepared and validated for business use.

✅ Data model → sales, product, and transaction tables linked via keys  
✅ Data quality checks → validation of categories, regions, prices, and transactions  
✅ Business aggregations → revenue by region, model, and payment method  
✅ Time-series analysis → monthly and yearly sales trends  
✅ Advanced calculations → average price, year-over-year comparison, category shares  

➡ Result: clean, consistent, and business-ready dataset for Power BI visualization.
